## Why GitHub for Ticketing?

Leveraging GitHub for our IT ticketing system allows us to:

* **Version Control:** Track changes and history of each IT issue.
* **Collaboration:** Facilitate easy collaboration among team members for troubleshooting and resolution.
* **Transparency:** Provide a transparent overview of all ongoing and resolved IT issues.
* **Automation (Future):** Lay the groundwork for potential future automation of workflows (e.g., auto-assigning, notifications) using GitHub Actions.

## How to Use

1.  **Create a new issue** for each IT problem you encounter by navigating to the "Issues" tab and clicking "New issue."
2.  Fill out all required fields in the issue template, providing as much detail as possible about the problem.
3.  Use appropriate labels for categorization and prioritization.
4.  Track progress and resolutions by adding comments, updating the issue status (e.g., "Open," "In Progress," "Closed"), and reassigning when necessary.
5.  Stay informed by monitoring GitHub notifications for updates on issues you're following or assigned to.

## Labels

Labels help us categorize and prioritize issues effectively:

* `hardware`: Issues related to physical components (e.g., laptop, monitor, printer).
* `software`: Issues with applications or operating systems (e.g., MS Office, Windows, custom app).
* `network`: Problems with connectivity or network devices (e.g., Wi-Fi, internet, VPN).
* `priority:high`: Critical issues impacting multiple users or core operations.
* `priority:medium`: Important issues affecting individuals or minor services.
* `priority:low`: Non-urgent issues or minor inconveniences.
